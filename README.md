# Natural-Language-Processing-and Sentiment-Analysis
This project shows Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis on hotel reviews using Python and NLTK. The tasks include cleaning raw text data, analysing sentiment using the VADER sentiment analyser, and visualizing insights with word clouds, histograms, and frequency plots. The dataset used contains hotel reviews, and the analysis focuses on understanding positive, negative, and neutral sentiment patterns across hotels, with a focus on the Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa.
Ttext preprocessing is performed by removing stopwords, tokenizing text, and applying stemming. Word clouds is generated to visualize commonly used terms in reviews. Sentiment analysis is carried out using NLTK’s VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, producing compound, positive, neutral, and negative sentiment scores for each review. These scores are examined using histograms and bar charts. The project also compares positive and negative reviews for Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa and highlights the most frequent words associated with each sentiment category.
All functionality is contained in a single Python file for simplicity and clarity. To run this project, Python 3 is required along with the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, and wordcloud. NLTK resources such as vader_lexicon, stopwords, punkt, wordnet, and omw-1.4 are downloaded automatically within the script. The dataset file Datafiniti_Hotel_Reviews.csv must be placed in the same directory as the Python file or the file path must be updated accordingly.
